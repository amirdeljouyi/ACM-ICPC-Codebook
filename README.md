# ACM-ICPC-Codebook

Useful code snippets and other goodies for competative programming

# Languages Used

**Java**

# Coding Conventions/Guidelines

* Tabs not spaces. (gives more code formating options)
* Open braces on the same lines as function definitions. (to save space)
* Implementations of algorithms should be contained within a working java class that will compile and do some sort of sanity check.
* To include only the important part of a source file in the notebook, surround the relevant part with the delimiter lines:

```java
/* START SOLUTION */
/* END SOLUTION */
```

# Notebook generation

The notebook can be generated using [notebook-gen](https://github.com/BudgieInWA/notebook-gen).
