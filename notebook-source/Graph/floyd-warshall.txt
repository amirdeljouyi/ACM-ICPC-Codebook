Floyd-Warshall

Assumes no negatice cycles.

All pairs shortest path.
Runs in n^3, takes n^3 space.

k=0 is our base case - dist(0,i,j) is the length of the edge from 
vertex i to vertex j if it exists, and \infty otherwise.

After N iterations, there is no need anymore to go through any more 
intermediate vertices, so the distance dist(N,i,j) represents the 
shortest distance between i and j.
