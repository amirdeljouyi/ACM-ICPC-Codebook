0-1 Knapsack

Only psuedocode right now :(

Define m[i,w] to be the maximum value that can be attained with weight less than or equal to w using items up to i (first i items).

The solution can then be found by calculating m[n,W]. To do this efficiently we can use a table to store previous computations.
